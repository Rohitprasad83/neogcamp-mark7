This is a pig latin translator. Pig Latin, or "Igpay Atinlay" is a language game or argot in which English words are altered, usually by adding a fabricated suffix or by moving the onset or initial consonant or consonant cluster of a word to the end of the word and adding a vocalic syllable to create such a suffix.

This app asks user for input, anything they want to say and then gets the pig latin translation of it.
